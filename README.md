# HTML & CSS Course Assignment

## Overview
This is the **HTML and CSS Course Assignment**, which builds upon the design assignment from the previous course. The objective is to recreate a webpage from Figma using **HTML and CSS**, ensuring a fully functional, accessible, and responsive website.

## Assignment Requirements
You must deliver a **properly functioning, responsive website** based on your **Design 1** assignment. The website must include every page listed in your site architecture. Some functionalities that require JavaScript can be mimicked using HTML attributes (e.g., a login button can link to a separate login page using the `action` attribute).

### Technical Requirements
- **HTML**:
  - Semantic and neatly formatted.
  - Each page must have a unique `<meta name="description">`, `<title>`, and `<h1>`.
  - No copied code; all code must be written by yourself.
- **CSS**:
  - Follow the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle**.
  - Use **Flexbox and CSS Grid** where appropriate.
  - Do **not** use a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap).
  - Ensure the site is fully **responsive** with no horizontal scrollbars.
- **Accessibility**:
  - The website should comply with **WCAG guidelines**.
  - Test accessibility using **WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools**.
- **Validation**:
  - Validate HTML using the **Markup Validation Service**.
  - Validate CSS using browser developer tools.

## Development Process
1. Analyze your **Figma prototype** and decide how to structure it with **HTML and CSS**.
2. Write semantic **HTML** and well-organized **CSS**, ensuring it follows best practices.
3. Implement **responsive design** using **media queries**, **Flexbox**, and/or **CSS Grid**.
4. Test your website using:
   - Browser developer tools.
   - Various screen sizes and major browsers.
5. Validate your **HTML and CSS** to ensure bug-free code.
6. Use **WAVE** to check accessibility compliance.
7. Share your site in the **HTML & CSS Peer Feedback** section on Moodle for review.
8. Review peer submissions and provide constructive feedback.
9. Improve your project based on received feedback.
10. Submit the final version on Moodle.
